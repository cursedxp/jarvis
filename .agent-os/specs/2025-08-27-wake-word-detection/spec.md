# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Wake Word Detection
> Created: 2025-08-27

## Overview

Implement wake word detection ("Hey Jarvis") that runs continuously in the background, allowing users to activate voice interactions hands-free. This feature will make the assistant truly voice-first by eliminating the need to manually click buttons to start voice conversations.

## User Stories

### Hands-Free Voice Activation

As a freelancer working on multiple tasks, I want to activate Jarvis by saying "Hey Jarvis" without touching my keyboard or mouse, so that I can maintain my workflow and get assistance without interruption.

When I'm coding or working on a document, I should be able to say "Hey Jarvis" at any time, and the system should immediately start listening for my command. The wake word detection should be reliable enough to avoid false positives while being sensitive enough to respond when I actually call for it. After detection, the system should provide clear audio/visual feedback that it's listening.

### Optional Wake Word Mode

As a user who sometimes works in quiet environments or prefers manual control, I want to toggle wake word detection on/off through settings, so that I can choose between hands-free and click-to-activate modes based on my current situation.

In shared workspaces or during meetings, I need to quickly disable wake word detection to prevent accidental activations. The setting should persist across sessions and clearly indicate the current mode in the UI. When wake word is disabled, the traditional "Start Voice Chat" button should be available.

## Spec Scope

1. **Wake Word Detection Engine** - Implement continuous background listening for "Hey Jarvis" using a lightweight, efficient detection library
2. **Settings Integration** - Add wake word detection toggle to the settings dialog with persistent storage
3. **UI Adaptation** - Dynamically show/hide voice activation button based on wake word setting
4. **Audio Feedback** - Provide clear audio cues when wake word is detected and system is listening
5. **Visual Indicators** - Update UI messages and indicators to reflect current wake word status

## Out of Scope

- Custom wake word configuration (fixed to "Hey Jarvis" for now)
- Multiple wake word support
- Voice training or personalization
- Offline wake word detection (requires internet for now)
- Wake word sensitivity adjustment

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can enable wake word detection in settings and activate Jarvis by saying "Hey Jarvis"
2. Voice chat button is hidden when wake word detection is active, shown when disabled
3. Welcome message updates based on wake word setting to guide users appropriately
