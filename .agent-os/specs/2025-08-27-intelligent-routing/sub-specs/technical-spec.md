# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-27-intelligent-routing/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-27
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### AI Router Service
- **IntelligentRouter Service**: Create a new `IntelligentRouter` service that uses the current active LLM to analyze user intent and return routing decisions within 300ms performance target.

### Intent Classification System
- **Intent Classification System**: Implement structured intent analysis that returns confidence scores, detected entities, and recommended handler/action pairs using JSON schema validation.

### Handler Integration Layer
- **Handler Integration Layer**: Modify existing `CommandRegistry` to accept routing decisions from `IntelligentRouter` while maintaining backward compatibility with existing command patterns.

### Context Management
- **Context Management**: Extend `ContextManager` to maintain conversation state, active feature awareness (timers, music playback), and routing history for context-aware decisions.

### Performance Monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring**: Add routing performance metrics, intent classification accuracy tracking, and fallback mechanisms for routing failures or timeouts.

### Socket.io Events
- **Socket.io Events**: Implement real-time routing decision events (`routing_decision`, `intent_classified`, `handler_switched`) for frontend debugging and user feedback.

### Caching Layer
- **Caching Layer**: Implement smart caching for common routing patterns to reduce LLM calls and improve response times for frequently used commands.

### Error Handling
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallback to keyword-based routing when AI analysis fails, with graceful degradation and error logging for system monitoring.

### Configuration System
- **Configuration System**: Add routing sensitivity settings, handler priority configuration, and intent confidence thresholds as user-configurable preferences.

### Testing Framework
- **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test coverage including unit tests for intent classification, integration tests for handler routing, and performance benchmarks for voice interaction latency.

## Approach

The intelligent routing system will be implemented as a middleware layer between user input processing and command execution. The system will leverage the existing LLM infrastructure to provide context-aware routing decisions while maintaining compatibility with the current command structure.

## External Dependencies

- Current LLM service integration (Claude/OpenAI)
- Socket.io for real-time events
- JSON schema validation library
- Performance monitoring tools
- Caching infrastructure (Redis or in-memory)
