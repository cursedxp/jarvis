> Spec: Intelligent Routing System
> Created: 2025-08-27

## Overview

Implement an AI-powered intelligent routing system for Jarvis that automatically determines when to use specific APIs, handlers, and LLM models based on natural language understanding of user intent. This system will enhance response quality by routing requests to the most appropriate handlers while maintaining voice-first interaction performance and supporting the existing multi-LLM architecture.

## User Stories

### Smart API Integration

As a user, I want to naturally ask Jarvis to "create a task for tomorrow" and have it automatically use the planning API to create the task, so that I don't need to learn specific command syntax or worry about which system handles what.

The system should understand context and intent from natural language, automatically route to the appropriate planning handler, execute the task creation via the MongoDB planning API, and provide confirmation of the action taken with real-time updates.

### Seamless Handler Routing

As a user, I want to start a pomodoro timer by saying "let's focus for 25 minutes" and have Jarvis automatically recognize this as a timer request, so that voice interactions feel natural and intelligent.

The system should detect productivity-related intents, route to the PomodoroHandler, start the timer with appropriate settings, and maintain awareness of timer state for future routing decisions.

### Context-Aware Conversations

As a user, I want Jarvis to maintain conversation context and know when I'm asking follow-up questions versus making new requests, so that conversations flow naturally without repetitive routing decisions.

The system should analyze conversation history, understand referential context, maintain routing state across turns, and seamlessly transition between general chat and specialized handlers.

## Spec Scope

1. **AI-Powered Intent Classification** - Replace keyword-based routing with LLM-powered natural language understanding that can detect user intent with high accuracy across all Jarvis capabilities.

2. **Multi-Handler Routing Logic** - Create intelligent routing between ChatHandler, PlanningHandler, PomodoroHandler, MusicHandler, and other specialized handlers based on intent analysis.

3. **API Integration Intelligence** - Automatically determine when to trigger specific APIs (planning/tasks, Spotify/music, timer controls) based on natural language requests without explicit command syntax.

4. **Context-Aware Decision Making** - Maintain conversation context and system state to make routing decisions based on current user session, active features, and conversation history.

5. **Performance-Optimized Design** - Ensure routing decisions complete within 300ms for voice interactions while maintaining accuracy and supporting real-time updates via Socket.io.

## Out of Scope

- Learning from user feedback or adaptive routing based on user patterns
- Voice command training or custom wake word configuration
- Integration with external APIs beyond current Jarvis capabilities
- Complex multi-step workflow routing or task chaining
- User interface changes beyond real-time routing feedback

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can interact with all Jarvis features using natural language without needing to know specific command syntax or handler boundaries.

2. Voice commands like "add a task", "play some music", "start a timer" are automatically routed to appropriate handlers with 95%+ accuracy.

3. System maintains sub-300ms routing performance for voice interactions while providing real-time feedback through Socket.io events.
