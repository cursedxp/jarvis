## 2025-08-27: Initial Product Architecture Decisions

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Architecture
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

Adopt a monorepo architecture with npm workspaces for managing the Jarvis application ecosystem.

### Context

Need to manage multiple packages (core backend, webapp frontend, shared utilities) while maintaining code consistency and enabling efficient development workflows.

### Rationale

- Simplified dependency management across packages
- Consistent tooling and configuration
- Easier refactoring and code sharing
- Better CI/CD pipeline management

## 2025-08-27: Multi-LLM Support Strategy

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, AI Engineers

### Decision

Implement support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama) with a unified interface abstraction.

### Context

Users have different preferences for AI models, privacy concerns, and cost considerations. Some prefer cloud-based solutions while others need local deployment.

### Rationale

- Flexibility for user preferences and requirements
- Reduced vendor lock-in
- Support for privacy-focused deployments (Ollama)
